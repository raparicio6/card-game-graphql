# Card Game

## Getting Started

### Installing

Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).  
Nvm approach is preferred.

Install dependencies by running `npm i`.

Create a *.env* file at the root of the project and add:  
`GAME_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001`  
By default [Backend](https://github.com/raparicio6/card-game-node) uses *http://localhost:3001* as the base url.

This project has its corresponding [Frontend](https://github.com/raparicio6/card-game-react) too.

#### Starting app

We have two ways to start the app. To start it in production mode run `npm start` in the root path of the project. To start it in development mode (nodemon) run `npm run start-dev`. Then access the app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you run the start script.

### Development

#### Environments

By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **NODE_ENV** environmental variable.

#### Environment variables

`Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They are stored in the `/.env` file. Take into account that the variables defined in the `bashrc` are not overrided.

The environment variables should be added to the `.env` file in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, as the following example:

```
PORT=8081
CLIENTS_API=http://api.clients.example.org/
```

**Remember not to push nor commit the `.env` file.**

#### Testing

In order to execute the tests run `npm test`.  
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) was used as the testing framework.
